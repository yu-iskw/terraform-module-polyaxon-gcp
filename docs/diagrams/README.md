# Diagrams
[mingrammer/diagrams: Diagram as Code for prototyping cloud system architectures](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams) enables us to visualize cloud/system architecture as python code.
It supports not only major public cloud service including GCP but also polyaxon, as I sent [a PR](https://github.com/mingrammer/diagrams/pull/74).

## Install diagrams
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Generate
```bash
$ python gcp_architecture.py
```
